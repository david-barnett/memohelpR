memohelpR is an experimental R package aiming to provides an easy way to
memoize functions with a disk cache, in the context of a project folder.

The main function, memoise_fun_in_proj, creates a memoized version of a
specified function, writing the cache to disk in a folder in the
project.

Currently this is a package aimed for my personal use but feel free to
comment.
